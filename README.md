# Flappy-Bird-Game
This is a game i built using Visual Studio - Windows Forms. It is where i started learning about C#, and using the different controllers on Windows Forms.

The .docx file just explains the different controllers i used when building the game and how it works (it is a Flappy birds game so we all know how it works :D i just had to do the explaining it being my school project).

The Flappy Birds Game file holds all of the files of the game.

Enjoy!!!
